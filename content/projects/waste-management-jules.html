    <h2>5. Guiding Questions</h2>
    <p>To tackle our chosen challenge, we broke it down with these specific questions. Each question guides a phase of
        our project.</p>
    <div class="question-list">
        <div class="question"><strong>GQ1:</strong> What are the most common types of recyclable materials found in
            municipal solid waste in Sri Lanka, and what are their physical properties?</div>
        <div class="question"><strong>GQ2:</strong> What are the existing state-of-the-art technologies for automated
            waste sorting, and what are their pros and cons in terms of cost, speed, and accuracy?</div>
        <div class="question"><strong>GQ3:</strong> Which combination of sensors is most effective for distinguishing
            between plastics (PET, HDPE), paper/cardboard, glass, and metals within our budget?</div>
        <div class="question"><strong>GQ4:</strong> What is the optimal mechanical design for the conveyor belt, robotic
            arm, and collection bins for a small-scale prototype?</div>
        <div class="question"><strong>GQ5:</strong> How can we develop a control algorithm to process sensor data in
            real-time and actuate the sorting mechanism accurately?</div>
    </div>

    <h2>6. Activities, Resources, and Findings</h2>
    <p>This section documents our research and development process as we answer our guiding questions.</p>
    <div class="activity-list">
        <!-- Activity for GQ1 -->
        <div class="activity">
            <h3>Answering GQ1: Material Identification</h3>
            <p><strong>Activities:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Literature review of reports from the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) of Sri Lanka.</li>
                <li>Contacting local waste collection centers (e.g., Kaduwela, Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia) to get anecdotal
                    data.</li>
                <li>Physically examining household waste to categorize common items.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="resources"><strong>Resources:</strong> CEA publications, YouTube documentaries on Sri Lankan
                waste, academic papers on waste characterization.</p>
            <p class="findings"><strong>Findings:</strong> The primary components are PET bottles (water, soda), HDPE
                (shampoo bottles), mixed paper, glass bottles, and aluminum cans. Contamination with food waste is a
                major issue. We must focus on these categories first.</p>

        <!-- Activity for GQ2 -->
        <div class="activity">
            <h3>Answering GQ2: Technology Research</h3>
            <p><strong>Activities:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Researching industrial sorting technologies like NIR (Near-Infrared), X-ray, and Eddy Current
                    separators.</li>
                <li>Analyzing DIY and open-source projects on platforms like Instructables, Hackaday, and GitHub.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="resources"><strong>Resources:</strong> Tomra Sorting Solutions website, research papers on
                sensor-based sorting, YouTube videos of sorting plants.</p>
            <p class="findings"><strong>Findings:</strong> Industrial solutions are too expensive. A combination of
                computer vision (using a Raspberry Pi and camera) for identifying shape/color and inductive sensors for
                metal detection seems most feasible for a prototype.</p>
