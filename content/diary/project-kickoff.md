## Meeting Overview

**Date:** January 10, 2025  
**Duration:** 2 hours  
**Attendees:** All team members + Supervisor

## Key Discussion Points

### Project Scope

Our supervisor emphasized the importance of selecting a project that addresses real-world problems in Sri Lanka. We discussed the balance between:

- Choosing familiar topics (mechanical/mechatronics) for career relevance
- Exploring new domains for broader learning experience

The team agreed to focus on **engineering solutions for Sri Lankan challenges**, with emphasis on practical implementation.

### Team Roles

We divided responsibilities based on individual strengths:

- **Mechanical students**: Focus on physical design, stress analysis, manufacturing
- **Mechatronics students**: Handle electronics, sensors, control systems, programming

Everyone will contribute to research and documentation.

### Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Brainstorm and research potential ideas
- **Week 3-4**: Narrow down to top 3 ideas, conduct feasibility analysis
- **Week 5**: Final idea selection and project proposal
- **Week 6+**: Detailed design and implementation

## Action Items

1. Each team member to research 2-3 potential project ideas by next meeting
2. Focus on problems specific to Sri Lanka
3. Consider cost, feasibility, and impact
4. Prepare brief presentations for next week

## Initial Ideas Discussed

We had preliminary discussions about several areas:

- Agricultural technology (irrigation, machinery)
- Urban infrastructure (waste management, transportation)
- Renewable energy systems
- Water purification and management
- Industrial automation

## Next Steps

Next meeting scheduled for January 17, 2025 to present and discuss researched ideas.

## Personal Reflections

Excited to start this project! The focus on Sri Lankan problems makes it feel more meaningful and relevant. Looking forward to combining our mechanical and mechatronics knowledge to create something impactful.
