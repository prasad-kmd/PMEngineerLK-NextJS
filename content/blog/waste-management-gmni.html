<h2 id="1-why-selected-waste-management-recycling-circular-economy-as-a-big-idea-">1. Why Selected &quot;Waste
    Management &amp; Recycling/Circular Economy&quot; as a Big Idea?</h2>
<p>This area was selected due to its pressing <strong>local relevance, national impact, and strong engineering
        applicability</strong> for a group with Mechanical and Mechatronics expertise.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Environmental Crisis &amp; Public Health:</strong> Sri Lanka faces significant challenges with unmanaged
        waste, leading to overflowing landfills (e.g., the historical Meethotamulla disaster), water pollution, and
        public health risks. An engineering solution here offers direct societal benefit.</li>
    <li><strong>Economic Opportunity:</strong> Shifting to a <strong>Circular Economy</strong>—where waste is viewed as
        a resource—creates new revenue streams, reduces reliance on expensive imports (e.g., raw materials for
        manufacturing), and fosters local innovation.</li>
    <li><strong>Engineering Scope (Mechanical &amp; Mechatronics):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mechanical:</strong> Project scope includes designing and prototyping new separation machinery,
                compaction systems, material transformation/processing devices, and waste-to-energy conversion systems.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Mechatronics:</strong> Project scope includes developing smart sensors for waste collection/bin
                fullness, automated sorting and identification systems (using vision/AI), and optimizing the control
                systems for recycling plants.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Alignment with National Goals:</strong> The concept aligns with Sri Lanka&#39;s long-term sustainability
        and resource management goals, ensuring the project is relevant to national policy.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-essential-questions-leading-to-challenges">2. Essential Questions Leading to Challenges</h2>
<p>These are broad, high-level questions that define the core problems within the Big Idea.</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Collection &amp; Logistics:</strong> How can we use technology to make waste collection more
        <strong>efficient, cost-effective, and complete</strong> across urban and remote areas of Sri Lanka?</li>
    <li><strong>Resource Recovery:</strong> How can we transform the current &#39;waste&#39; stream into a consistent,
        high-quality <strong>secondary raw material</strong> for local industries?</li>
    <li><strong>Policy &amp; Behaviour:</strong> How can engineering solutions and design change <strong>consumer and
            industrial behaviour</strong> to reduce waste generation and improve source separation?</li>
    <li><strong>Value Addition &amp; Processing:</strong> What cost-effective and energy-efficient <strong>local
            processing technologies</strong> can convert currently unrecyclable or low-value waste (e.g., non-PET
        plastics, organic matter) into usable energy or products?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-list-of-potential-challenges-in-the-big-idea">3. List of Potential Challenges in the Big Idea</h2>
<p>These are specific, actionable problems derived from the essential questions that require a technical solution.</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Challenge 1: Improving Source Separation:</strong> The lack of effective segregation at the
        household/commercial level leads to contamination of recycling streams.</li>
    <li><strong>Challenge 2: Inefficient Collection Routes:</strong> Waste collection vehicles follow static,
        inefficient routes, leading to unnecessary fuel consumption and high operational costs.</li>
    <li><strong>Challenge 3: Low-Value Plastic Upcycling:</strong> Developing an affordable, small-scale process/machine
        to convert difficult-to-recycle, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) or multi-layer plastics into a useful
        construction or manufacturing product (e.g., tiles, filament).</li>
    <li><strong>Challenge 4: Organic Waste Management:</strong> Managing large quantities of municipal or market organic
        waste effectively in urban areas without large, centralised composting facilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Challenge 5: Localised E-Waste Processing:</strong> Establishing a safe, localized mechanical
        pre-processing system for end-of-life small electronics (E-Waste) before materials are exported for final
        recovery.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-why-selected-that-challenge-">4. Why Selected That Challenge?</h2>
<p><em>(<strong>Note:</strong> For the purpose of providing a complete example, I will select <strong>Challenge 3:
            Low-Value Plastic Upcycling</strong> as the focus, as it strongly leverages both Mechanical and Mechatronics
        skills.)</em></p>
<p>We select <strong>Challenge 3: Low-Value Plastic Upcycling</strong> because it directly addresses a critical gap in
    Sri Lanka&#39;s recycling system.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>High Technical Skill Integration:</strong> It demands expertise in:<ul>
            <li><strong>Mechanical Engineering:</strong> Designing the <strong>shredding, extrusion, and
                    moulding</strong> systems to handle variable plastic inputs and create a structurally sound product.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Mechatronics Engineering:</strong> Developing the <strong>precision control systems</strong> for
                temperature, pressure, and throughput to ensure the quality and consistency of the final recycled
                product.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Economic Viability:</strong> Low-value plastics are currently landfilled or incinerated. Finding a way
        to convert them into high-value, locally usable products (e.g., pavement blocks, roofing materials) creates a
        profitable <strong>circular business model</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Local Relevance:</strong> This type of small-scale, decentralized processing is ideal for implementation
        in various districts, reducing the cost of transporting waste to centralized facilities.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5-guiding-questions">5. Guiding Questions</h2>
<p>These questions break down the chosen challenge (<strong>Low-Value Plastic Upcycling</strong>) into specific research
    and design tasks.</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Material Science:</strong> What is the optimal <strong>blend ratio and pre-treatment</strong> process
        for common low-value plastics (e.g., plastic bags, wrappers) to ensure structural integrity and durability of
        the final product?</li>
    <li><strong>Mechanical Design:</strong> What is the most <strong>energy-efficient and mechanically robust</strong>
        method for shredding and preparing heterogeneous plastic waste for processing?</li>
    <li><strong>Process Control:</strong> What <strong>temperature and pressure control system (Mechatronics)</strong>
        is required to consistently melt and extrude the plastic blend to maintain product quality and safety?</li>
    <li><strong>Product Utility:</strong> What is the most locally useful, high-demand product that can be reliably
        manufactured from this recycled plastic composite (e.g., pavers, road base material, furniture components)?</li>
    <li><strong>Scalability &amp; Safety:</strong> How can the resulting machine/system be designed to be <strong>safe,
            modular, and affordable</strong> for small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) in Sri Lanka?</li>
