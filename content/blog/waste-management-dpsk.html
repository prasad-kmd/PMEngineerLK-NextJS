<h3 id="-why-select-waste-management-circular-economy-as-a-big-idea-">💡 Why Select &quot;Waste Management &amp;
    Circular Economy&quot; as a Big Idea?</h3>
<p>This topic is not just an environmental issue but a critical economic and social challenge for Sri Lanka, making it a
    compelling &quot;Big Idea.&quot; Here’s why:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>National Relevance and Urgency</strong>: Sri Lanka generates millions of tonnes of solid waste annually,
        and research shows this is a growing challenge driven by urbanization and changing consumption patterns . This
        makes it a nationally significant problem worthy of an engineering solution.</li>
    <li><strong>Systemic Change Over Incremental Improvement</strong>: The circular economy represents a fundamental
        shift from the traditional <strong>linear &quot;take-make-waste&quot; model</strong> to a system where materials
        never become waste and nature is regenerated . This systemic view provides a vast landscape for innovation.</li>
    <li><strong>Alignment with Engineering Skills</strong>: This Big Idea perfectly leverages your team&#39;s diverse
        skills. <strong>Mechanical engineering</strong> principles are crucial for designing robust machinery for waste
        processing, recycling, and material recovery. <strong>Mechatronics</strong> is key for automating these
        processes, integrating sensors for sorting, and developing smart systems for waste monitoring and management .
    </li>
    <li><strong>Global and Local Momentum</strong>: There is a global push towards a circular economy, with evidence
        that it can generate trillions in economic output and significantly cut greenhouse gas emissions . Sri Lankan
        research also identifies sustainability practices, waste-to-energy conversion, and recycling as dominant themes,
        showing local academic and practical interest .</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-essential-questions-within-the-big-idea">❓ Essential Questions Within the Big Idea</h3>
<p>Essential questions are broad, open-ended, and probe the core of the problem. Considering these will lead you to
    specific, solvable challenges.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Systemic &amp; Economic Questions</strong>: How can Sri Lanka transition from a linear
        &quot;dispose-of&quot; waste management model to a circular &quot;resource-recovery&quot; model? What circular
        business models (e.g., product-as-a-service, sharing platforms) could be viable in the Sri Lankan context ? How
        can we design out waste and pollution from the very beginning ?</li>
    <li><strong>Technical &amp; Technological Questions</strong>: How can we efficiently sort and process different
        waste streams (plastic, organic, C&amp;D waste) in Sri Lanka? What affordable and robust technologies can be
        developed for recycling and waste-to-energy conversion ? How can automation and IoT be used to create smarter,
        more efficient waste collection and management systems?</li>
    <li><strong>Social &amp; Infrastructural Questions</strong>: How can we improve household and community
        participation in waste separation and recycling programs ? How can the informal sector (e.g., waste pickers) be
        integrated and valued in a formal circular economy ? What are the most significant barriers to implementing
        circular economy strategies in specific sectors like construction ?</li>
</ul>
