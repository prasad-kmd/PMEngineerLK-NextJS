        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Industry Modernization:</strong> Identifying a common, repetitive task in a local industry
                (e.g., tea processing, garment manufacturing) and designing a cost-effective, automated machine or
                robotic system to replace it, using advanced <strong>mechanical</strong> linkages and
                <strong>mechatronics</strong> control.</li>
            <li><strong>Smart Warehousing/Port Operations:</strong> Developing a small-scale prototype of an automated
                material handling or sorting system (e.g., conveyor belts, pick-and-place robots) to increase efficiency
                in the Port of Colombo or a major warehouse.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Designing a low-cost, automated irrigation system that uses
                <strong>sensors</strong> (Mechatronics) to monitor soil moisture and weather data, and
                <strong>mechanical</strong> valves/pumps to optimize water usage in paddy fields or spice plantations.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Post-Harvest Loss Reduction:</strong> Developing a <strong>mechanical</strong> design for a
                low-cost, efficient, and appropriate technology for local crop drying, chilling, or sorting to prevent
