    <h1>Big Idea: Waste Management & Recycling in a Circular Economy</h1>
    <p><strong>Team:</strong> Mechanical & Mechatronics Engineering Undergraduates</p>
    <p><strong>Context:</strong> Sri Lanka</p>

<div class="section" id="why-big-idea">
    <h2>1. Why We Selected This as a "Big Idea"</h2>
    <p>The management of solid waste is one of the most critical environmental and social challenges facing Sri Lanka
        today. Rapid urbanization, population growth, and a rise in consumerism have led to an exponential increase in
        waste generation, overwhelming existing infrastructure. This topic was chosen for several key reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>National Relevance:</strong> Improper waste disposal leads to polluted land, waterways, and
            coastlines, directly impacting public health, tourism, and biodiversity in Sri Lanka. Landfills like
            Kerawalapitiya and Aruwakkalu are temporary fixes to a permanent problem.</li>
        <li><strong>Engineering Challenge:</strong> This area is rich with opportunities for mechanical and mechatronics
            innovation. It moves beyond simple civil engineering to complex systems involving automation, robotics, data
            science, and machine design.</li>
        <li><strong>Career Experience:</strong> It provides direct, hands-on experience in high-demand fields such as
            Industrial Automation, Robotics (for sorting), IoT (for smart collection), and Sustainable System Design.
            These skills are transferable to manufacturing, logistics, and beyond.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Potential:</strong> Adopting a circular economy model—where waste is not just disposed of
            but is a resource for new products—can create new industries, generate revenue, and reduce reliance on
            imported raw materials.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Essential Questions Considered</h2>
    <p>To explore this Big Idea, we started with broad questions to understand the entire ecosystem:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How can technology bridge the gap between waste generation and effective recycling?</li>
        <li>What are the primary obstacles (technical, economic, social) to implementing a successful circular economy
            in the Sri Lankan context?</li>
        ... (The user can add more questions here)
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Potential Challenges within the Big Idea</h2>
    <p>From our essential questions, we identified several specific, addressable challenges. One of these will be
        selected for our project focus.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Inefficient and Hazardous Manual Waste Sorting:</strong> The current process at municipal collection
            points is slow, inaccurate, and poses significant health risks to workers. This leads to low-quality,
            contaminated recyclables.</li>
        <li><strong>E-Waste (Electronic Waste) Management Crisis:</strong> There is a lack of a formalized, safe, and
            efficient system for collecting, dismantling, and extracting valuable materials from e-waste, leading to
            toxic materials leaching into the environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimizing Waste Collection Logistics:</strong> Municipal waste collection routes are often static
            and inefficient, leading to high fuel consumption, overflowing bins in some areas, and unnecessary trips in
            others.</li>
        <li><strong>Agricultural/Organic Waste Valorization:</strong> A significant portion of waste is organic.
            Developing small-to-medium scale systems to convert this waste into biogas or high-quality compost at a
            local level is a major challenge.</li>
        <li><strong>Plastic Recycling and Repurposing:</strong> Specifically addressing the challenge of low-value
            plastics (like sachets and food wrappers) that are not typically recycled and end up polluting the
            environment.</li>
    </ol>
