    <div class="entry-date">Week 1: Identifying the Big Idea</div>
    <p>Our initial brainstorming sessions revolved around finding a topic that was both challenging and meaningful. The
        supervisor's suggestion to explore outside our direct field was considered, but the team felt a strong pull
        towards applying our engineering skills to a pressing national problem. The consensus was that gaining
        career-relevant experience was a priority.</p>
    <p>We settled on <strong>"Waste Management & a Circular Economy"</strong>. It felt right. It's a visible, tangible
        problem in Sri Lanka, and we could see immediate potential for mechanical and mechatronics solutions.</p>

    <h2>4. Why We Selected Our Challenge</h2>
    <p>After listing several potential challenges in our <a href="ideas.html">Ideas document</a>, we had to make a
        crucial decision. We chose: <strong>Challenge #1: Inefficient and Hazardous Manual Waste Sorting.</strong></p>
    <p>This choice was deliberate for the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct Application of Skills:</strong> It is a classic mechatronics problem. It requires a system
            with sensors (to identify materials), actuators and robotic arms (to sort), and a mechanical conveyor system
            (to move the waste). This aligns perfectly with our team's skillset.</li>
        <li><strong>High Impact Potential:</strong> Automating this process would not only dramatically increase the
            speed and purity of recyclables but also remove human workers from a dangerous and unhygienic environment.
            This has both economic and ethical benefits.</li>
        <li><strong>Feasibility for a Prototype:</strong> While a full-scale industrial plant is beyond our scope,
            designing and building a small-scale, functional prototype is an achievable and impressive goal for an
            undergraduate project. We can demonstrate the proof-of-concept effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Innovation Space:</strong> There is room for innovation in sensor fusion (e.g., combining computer
            vision with inductive sensors for metals), sorting algorithms, and cost-effective robotic gripper design.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Our project mission is now clear:</strong> To design and build a prototype of an automated waste sorting
        system to improve the efficiency and safety of recycling in Sri Lanka.</p>
