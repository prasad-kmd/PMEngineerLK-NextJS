## About Our Team

We are a group of mechanical and mechatronics engineering students from Sri Lanka, embarking on an exciting undergraduate group project. Our diverse backgrounds bring together expertise in:

- Mechanical design and manufacturing
- Electronics and embedded systems
- Control systems and automation
- Software development

## Project Vision

Our goal is to identify significant engineering challenges in Sri Lanka and develop practical, implementable solutions. We believe that engineering should serve society, and what better way to learn than by solving real problems in our own country?

## Why Sri Lanka?

Sri Lanka faces unique challenges that require localized solutions:

- **Agricultural sector**: Small-scale farmers need affordable technology
- **Urban development**: Rapid urbanization creates waste and infrastructure challenges
- **Resource constraints**: Solutions must be cost-effective and use local materials
- **Climate change**: Increasing need for sustainable and resilient systems

## Our Approach

We're taking a systematic, engineering-driven approach:

1. **Research**: Understanding problems deeply through stakeholder engagement
2. **Innovation**: Developing creative solutions using our technical skills
3. **Practicality**: Ensuring solutions are affordable and implementable
4. **Impact**: Measuring real-world benefits and scalability

## What to Expect

This website will document our entire journey:

- **Ideas**: Detailed project proposals and technical analyses
- **Diary**: Regular updates on our progress and learnings
- **Workflow**: Our methodologies and processes
- **Posts**: General updates and insights

## Get Involved

We welcome feedback, suggestions, and collaboration opportunities. If you're interested in our work or have ideas to share, please reach out!

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to our supervisor for guidance and the university for providing resources and support for this project.
