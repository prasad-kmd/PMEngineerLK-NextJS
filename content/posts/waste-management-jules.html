    <section>
        <p><strong>The problem is all around us.</strong> From the bustling streets of Colombo to the serene beaches of
            the south, waste is a growing challenge for Sri Lanka. As a team of mechatronics and mechanical engineering
            students, we believe that the most complex challenges present the greatest opportunities for innovation.
            That's why we've chosen to focus our undergraduate project on a critical piece of the puzzle: <strong>waste
                management</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Why Waste?</h2>
        <p>The path to a sustainable future runs through a circular economy—an ecosystem where waste is not an endpoint,
            but a beginning. However, for waste to become a valuable resource, it must be sorted efficiently and
            accurately. In Sri Lanka, this process is largely manual. It's slow, costly, and, most importantly, it's a
            hazardous job for the people involved.</p>
        <blockquote>
            "We saw a problem that was not just about logistics, but about human dignity and technological opportunity.
            We knew we could apply our skills here to make a real difference."
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Our Challenge: Building an Automated Sorting System</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to design and build a small-scale prototype of an automated waste sorting system. Imagine a
            conveyor belt carrying mixed waste, where a smart system—our "eyes" and "hands"—works tirelessly to separate
            valuable materials.</p>

        <h3>How It Works (Our Vision):</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The Conveyor:</strong> A steady stream of mixed waste (plastics, paper, metal) travels along a
                conveyor belt.</li>
            <li><strong>The 'Eyes' (Sensing):</strong> A camera, powered by a computer vision algorithm, identifies
                items based on their shape, size, and color. An inductive sensor positioned under the belt detects the
                presence of metal.</li>
            <li><strong>The 'Brain' (Processing):</strong> A microcontroller, like a Raspberry Pi, processes the data
                from the sensors in milliseconds to determine what each item is and where it is.</li>
            <li><strong>The 'Hand' (Actuation):</strong> Based on the brain's decision, a robotic arm with a specialized
                gripper is activated to pick the target item off the belt and drop it into the correct collection bin
                (e.g., one for PET plastics, one for metals).</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
        <p>This project is more than just a technical exercise. It's a blueprint for a more efficient, safer, and more
            sustainable recycling industry in Sri Lanka. By proving that low-cost, effective automation is possible, we
            hope to inspire further investment and innovation in the circular economy.</p>
        <p>This is not just about managing waste; it's about creating value, protecting our environment, and building a
            healthier future for our communities. Follow our journey as we turn this idea into a reality!</p>
