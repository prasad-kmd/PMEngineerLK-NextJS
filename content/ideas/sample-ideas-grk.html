            <td><strong>Smart Irrigation Systems for Sustainable Agriculture</strong></td>
            <td>Sri Lanka&#39;s agriculture (rice, tea, coconut) faces water scarcity due to erratic monsoons, climate
                change, and inefficient canal systems (e.g., 40% water loss in irrigation). This affects 2.5M farmers
                and food security.</td>
            <td>Design a low-cost, solar-powered mechatronic irrigation system using sensors (soil moisture, weather)
                and automated valves/pumps to optimize water use by 30-50%, integrated with mobile apps for farmer
                alerts.</td>
            <td><strong>Mechanical</strong>: Pump/valve design, fluid dynamics. <strong>Mechatronics</strong>: Sensor
                integration, IoT controls. Career boost: High demand in agrotech firms like Hayleys or MAS Holdings;

            <td>Energy poverty in rural areas (e.g., Upcountry estates) with frequent blackouts; 80% reliance on
                imported fossil fuels costs $4B/year. Solar/wind potential is underutilized.</td>
            <td>Develop a hybrid microgrid system (solar panels + small wind turbines) with mechanical energy storage
                (flywheels) and smart controllers to provide reliable power for 50-100 households, reducing diesel use
                by 70%.</td>

            <td><strong>4</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Efficient Electric Rickshaw (Tuk-Tuk) Fleet Management</strong></td>
            <td>Urban congestion in Colombo/Kandy; 1M+ polluting tuk-tuks cause air pollution (PM2.5 exceeds WHO limits)
                and high fuel costs amid forex crisis. EV adoption is &lt;5%.</td>
            <td>Create a modular EV tuk-tuk chassis with regenerative braking, battery swapping stations, and
