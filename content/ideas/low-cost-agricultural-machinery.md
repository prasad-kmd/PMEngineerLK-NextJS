description: "Affordable, locally-manufactured multi-purpose agricultural equipment designed for Sri Lankan small-scale farmers with limited capital."
---

## Background

Over 80% of Sri Lankan farmers operate on less than 2 hectares of land. These small-scale farmers cannot afford expensive imported machinery, forcing them to rely on manual labor or expensive rental equipment.

## Problem Analysis

**Current Challenges:**
- Imported machinery costs LKR 500,000 - 2,000,000 (unaffordable for small farmers)
- Rental equipment often unavailable during peak seasons
- Manual labor is time-consuming and physically demanding
- Low productivity limits income potential

## Proposed Solution

Design and manufacture a **modular, multi-purpose agricultural machine** using locally available materials and components, targeting a price point of LKR 75,000 (≈ $250 USD).

### Key Features

1. **Modular Design**: Interchangeable attachments for different tasks
2. **Local Manufacturing**: Uses standard steel sections and locally available parts
3. **Easy Maintenance**: Simple mechanical design, no complex electronics
4. **Multi-Purpose**: Plowing, harrowing, seeding, and transport functions

### Technical Design

**Base Unit Specifications:**
- **Engine**: 5-7 HP diesel engine (locally available)
- **Transmission**: Chain drive with 3-speed gearbox
- **Frame**: Welded mild steel construction
- **Weight**: Approximately 150 kg
- **Operating Speed**: 2-5 km/h

**Interchangeable Attachments:**
1. Moldboard plow (for primary tillage)
2. Disc harrow (for secondary tillage)
3. Seed drill (for planting)
4. Trailer hitch (for transport)

### Force Analysis for Plowing

The draft force required for plowing can be estimated using:

$$
F_{draft} = A \times d \times v \times K
$$

Where:
- $$F_{draft}$$ = Draft force (N)
- $$A$$ = Cross-sectional area of furrow (m²)
- $$d$$ = Depth of plowing (m)
- $$v$$ = Forward velocity (m/s)
- $$K$$ = Soil-specific constant (N·s/m³)

For typical Sri Lankan paddy soil ($$K \approx 50,000$$ N·s/m³):

$$
F_{draft} = 0.02 \times 0.15 \times 0.5 \times 50,000 = 75 \text{ N}
$$

**Power Requirement:**

$$
P = \frac{F_{draft} \times v}{\eta}
$$

Where $$\eta$$ = mechanical efficiency (≈ 0.7)

$$
P = \frac{75 \times 0.5}{0.7} \approx 54 \text{ W} \approx 0.07 \text{ HP}
$$

This confirms a 5 HP engine provides adequate power with safety margin.

## Manufacturing Plan

**Materials Cost Breakdown:**

| Component | Cost (LKR) |
|-----------|-----------|
| Diesel engine (5 HP) | 35,000 |
| Steel sections & plates | 15,000 |
| Wheels & axles | 8,000 |
| Chain drive & gearbox | 7,000 |
| Fasteners & hardware | 3,000 |
| Paint & finishing | 2,000 |
| **Total Materials** | **70,000** |
| Labor & overhead | 5,000 |
| **Final Cost** | **75,000** |

**Manufacturing Process:**
1. Cut and weld frame components
2. Install engine and transmission
3. Fabricate and attach implements
4. Test and quality control

**Production Time:** 3-4 days per unit with small workshop setup

## Business Model

**Target Market:**
- Small-scale farmers (1-2 hectare plots)
- Farmer cooperatives (shared ownership)
- Agricultural training centers

**Distribution:**
- Direct sales through agricultural extension offices
- Demonstrations at farmer markets
- Microfinance partnerships for payment plans

**Projected Impact:**
- Reduce plowing time from 3 days to 4 hours per hectare
- Enable timely planting (critical for yield)
- Increase farmer income by 25-30% through productivity gains

## Implementation Roadmap

**Month 1-2:** Design and prototype development
**Month 3-4:** Field testing with 5 farmer families
**Month 5-6:** Refinement based on feedback
**Month 7-8:** Setup manufacturing facility
**Month 9-12:** Production and distribution of first 50 units

## Skills Required

- **Mechanical Design**: CAD modeling, stress analysis
- **Manufacturing**: Welding, machining, assembly
- **Agricultural Engineering**: Understanding of soil mechanics and farming operations
- **Business Development**: Marketing, distribution, financing

## Sustainability Considerations

- Use of locally sourced materials reduces carbon footprint
- Diesel engine can be converted to biodiesel
- Modular design extends product lifetime
- Creates local employment in manufacturing and maintenance
