<h2 id="-1-why-selected-this-as-a-big-idea-"><strong>1. Why Selected This as a Big Idea</strong></h2>
<p>Waste generation in Sri Lanka has grown rapidly with urbanization, population increase, and industrial activity. Most
    waste ends up in open dumps without proper segregation or recycling. Municipal systems struggle to handle plastic,
    e-waste, and organic waste efficiently.</p>
<p>Selecting this as a big idea allows your group to explore <strong>practical engineering approaches</strong> that
    reduce environmental impact while promoting sustainability. It connects mechanical and mechatronic knowledge with
    real community needs—designing machines, automation, or systems that improve sorting, collection, or reuse
    processes.</p>
<p>In short, this topic is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Environmentally urgent and socially meaningful.</li>
    <li>Technically rich, combining mechanics, sensors, and control.</li>
    <li>Scalable for prototype development.</li>
    <li>Relevant to both public and industrial applications.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-2-essential-questions-within-the-big-idea-"><strong>2. Essential Questions Within the Big Idea</strong></h2>
<p>These are broad, thought-provoking questions that guided your exploration before defining specific challenges:</p>
<ol>
    <li>How can waste be reduced, reused, or recycled efficiently within Sri Lanka’s current infrastructure?</li>
    <li>What role can automation and mechanical innovation play in improving waste collection and sorting?</li>
    <li>How can communities or industries adopt a circular economy mindset instead of linear consumption?</li>
    <li>What are the economic and energy costs of existing recycling methods, and how can they be improved?</li>
    <li>How can technology help convert waste into valuable resources or energy?</li>
    <li>How can awareness and small-scale innovations encourage sustainable waste practices at local levels?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="-3-list-of-possible-challenges-"><strong>3. List of Possible Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>(These are potential problem areas within the Big Idea—your team will choose one.)</p>
<ol>
    <li>Inefficient waste segregation at source in households and markets.</li>
    <li>Lack of affordable small-scale waste sorting systems for local councils.</li>
    <li>Plastic waste not properly collected or reused.</li>
    <li>Absence of low-cost shredders and compactors for community-level recycling.</li>
    <li>Food and organic waste not being converted to compost or biogas.</li>
    <li>E-waste not properly collected or dismantled safely.</li>
    <li>Lack of incentive or monitoring systems for proper waste separation.</li>
    <li>Poor logistics and data tracking in municipal waste collection.</li>
    <li>Recyclable materials being mixed and contaminated during transport.</li>
    <li>Inadequate awareness or access to circular economy practices among small industries.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="-4-why-selected-that-challenge-"><strong>4. Why Selected That Challenge</strong></h2>
<p>(<em>Example selection for you to adapt depending on what you choose</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Selected Challenge:</strong> <em>Plastic waste not properly collected or reused in small communities.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Selection:</strong>
    Plastic pollution is one of Sri Lanka’s most visible environmental problems, affecting waterways, beaches, and urban
    areas. Community-level collection is inefficient, and large-scale recycling plants cannot process mixed or
    contaminated plastic. A low-cost mechanical or automated solution designed for local councils or small communities
    could greatly improve collection and reuse. This challenge also aligns with our team’s engineering background,
    allowing the integration of <strong>mechanical design, sensors, and control systems</strong> to develop an efficient
    solution such as a <strong>smart plastic sorting and shredding unit</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-5-guiding-questions-"><strong>5. Guiding Questions</strong></h2>
<p>These are research and design questions that guide your project work once the challenge is chosen:</p>
<ol>
    <li>What are the main types of plastic waste produced in local communities?</li>
    <li>How can we design a low-cost mechanism to sort or shred different plastics efficiently?</li>
    <li>What sensors or control methods can be used to identify material types (by color, density, or other properties)?
    </li>
    <li>How can the system be powered and maintained with minimal cost in rural or small-town settings?</li>
    <li>What safety and environmental factors must be considered in operation?</li>
    <li>How can the design support circular reuse (e.g., turning shredded plastic into usable raw material)?</li>
    <li>What partnerships or local users (e.g., councils, schools, recycling centers) could benefit from this system?
    </li>
