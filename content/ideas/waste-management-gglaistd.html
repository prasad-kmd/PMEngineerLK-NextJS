<h3 id="1-why-selected-this-as-a-big-idea-">1. Why selected this as a big idea?</h3>
<p>This idea was selected because Sri Lanka faces substantial challenges with municipal solid waste due to population
    growth, urbanization, and changing consumption patterns. Open dumping remains a primary disposal method, leading to
    significant environmental pollution, health hazards, and loss of valuable resources. Issues like inadequate
    infrastructure, lack of waste segregation, and insufficient funding create a critical need for innovative
    engineering solutions. For a team of mechanical and mechatronics engineers, this field offers immense opportunity to
    design and automate systems that can tackle these problems directly, contributing to a more sustainable, circular
    economy by turning waste into a resource.</p>
<h3 id="2-list-the-essential-questions-considered-within-the-big-idea-that-led-to-a-number-of-challenges-">2. List the
    “Essential Questions” considered within the Big Idea that led to a number of challenges.</h3>
<p>To explore this broad topic, we considered several key questions that highlight the underlying problems in the Sri
    Lankan context:</p>
<ul>
    <li>How can we improve the sorting of mixed municipal waste to make recycling more efficient and economically
        viable?</li>
    <li>What are the most effective small-scale, decentralized methods for processing organic waste, which makes up a
        large portion of the country&#39;s municipal waste?</li>
    <li>How can technology address the growing problem of electronic waste (e-waste) and allow for the safe recovery of
        valuable materials?</li>
    <li>What engineering solutions can convert the high volume of plastic waste, particularly single-use plastics, into
        valuable new products?</li>
    <li>How can automation improve the safety and efficiency of waste collection and handling processes?</li>
    <li>What systems are needed to effectively manage and recycle construction and demolition waste, which is often
        disposed of in landfills?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-list-all-challenges-in-the-big-idea">3. List all challenges in the Big Idea</h3>
<p>Based on the essential questions, here are several specific engineering challenges:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Automated Sorting of Mixed Recyclables:</strong> Design a low-cost, automated system using sensors and
        actuators to separate plastics (like PET and HDPE), paper, metal, and glass from a commingled waste stream.</li>
    <li><strong>Decentralized Organic Waste Processor:</strong> Develop a compact, automated anaerobic digester or
        composter for use at a community or municipal level to convert food and garden waste into biogas and fertilizer.
    </li>
    <li><strong>E-Waste Component Recovery System:</strong> Create a semi-automated workstation for the safe disassembly
        of electronic waste (e.g., mobile phones, computers) to harvest and sort valuable components like printed
        circuit boards and metals.</li>
    <li><strong>Plastic Waste-to-Filament Production Unit:</strong> Design and build an integrated machine that cleans,
        shreds, melts, and extrudes common plastic waste (like PET bottles) into high-quality 3D printer filament.</li>
    <li><strong>Smart Waste Collection and Logistics System:</strong> Develop an IoT-based system with sensors in public
        bins to monitor fill levels and software to optimize collection routes for municipal trucks, saving fuel and
        time.</li>
    <li><strong>Mobile Construction Debris Recycler:</strong> Design a portable machine that can crush and sort
        concrete, brick, and other construction debris on-site into aggregates of different sizes for reuse in new
        construction projects.</li>
</ol>

    <strong><em>Let&#39;s proceed assuming your team selects Challenge #4: Plastic Waste-to-Filament Production
            Unit.</em></strong></h2>
<h3 id="4-why-selected-that-challenge-">4. Why selected that challenge?</h3>
<p>This challenge was selected for three key reasons. First, plastic pollution is a severe and highly visible
    environmental issue in Sri Lanka, with a large volume of plastic waste being mismanaged. This project directly
    addresses the problem by upcycling a prevalent waste material into a valuable product. Second, the project is an
    excellent fit for the combined skills of mechanical and mechatronics engineering students, involving material
    processing, thermal systems, extrusion mechanics, sensor integration, and real-time control systems. Third, the
    outcome has strong practical value. Locally produced, low-cost 3D printer filament can support innovation in local
    schools, universities, and small businesses, creating a tangible link between waste management and economic
    empowerment.</p>
<h3 id="5-list-guiding-questions">5. List guiding questions</h3>
<p>To effectively tackle this challenge, your team should focus on answering these guiding questions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Which common plastic waste types in Sri Lanka (e.g., PET, HDPE, PP) are most suitable for conversion into 3D
        printer filament based on their material properties and availability?</li>
    <li>What is the necessary pre-processing procedure (cleaning, drying, shredding) to prepare the recovered plastic
        for a consistent extrusion process?</li>
    <li>How can we design a reliable and safe extrusion system that can melt the plastic and force it through a nozzle
        at a consistent rate?</li>
    <li>What combination of sensors and control algorithms is needed to precisely monitor and maintain the
        filament&#39;s diameter (e.g., to 1.75 mm ±0.05 mm) in real-time?</li>
    <li>How can the extruded filament be cooled and spooled uniformly to prevent deformation and ensure it is usable in
        a standard 3D printer?</li>
    <li>What tests are required to validate the quality and consistency of the final filament product?</li>
</ol>
