<h3 id="big-idea-1-precision-agriculture-food-security">Big Idea 1: Precision Agriculture &amp; Food Security</h3>
<p>Sri Lanka&#39;s economy is heavily reliant on agriculture, but it faces challenges like water scarcity, high post-harvest losses, and unpredictable weather.</p>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s good for your group:</strong> This applies core Mechanical (structures, fluids, thermodynamics) and Mechatronics (sensors, control systems, automation) principles to a non-engineering field.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Project Challenges/Solutions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Optimizing water usage in paddy or vegetable cultivation.<ul>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> Design a low-cost, solar-powered, IoT-based smart irrigation system. (Mechatronics: moisture sensors, microcontroller, valve control. Mechanical: pump selection, fluid dynamics, solar panel mounting).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Reducing post-harvest losses of fruits (like bananas, mangoes) and vegetables during storage and transport.<ul>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> Develop a modular, passive-cooling storage unit for small-scale farmers. (Mechanical: thermodynamics, heat transfer, material selection for insulation. Mechatronics: simple temperature/humidity monitoring).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Inefficient and labor-intensive process of tea plucking.<ul>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> Prototype a semi-autonomous, robotic tea-plucking aid that can identify &quot;two leaves and a bud.&quot; (Mechatronics: computer vision, robotic arm control. Mechanical: end-effector design, lightweight chassis).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="big-idea-2-sustainable-fisheries-marine-conservation">Big Idea 2: Sustainable Fisheries &amp; Marine Conservation</h3>
<p>The fishing industry is vital for nutrition and livelihood, but it&#39;s threatened by overfishing, fuel costs, and bycatch.</p>
<p><strong>Why it&#39;s good for your group:</strong> This involves marine mechanics, robotics, and sensor systems—a perfect blend for your skillset.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Project Challenges/Solutions:</strong></p>
<ul>
