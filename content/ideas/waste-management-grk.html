<p>The selection of &quot;Waste Management &amp; Recycling/ Circular Economy&quot; as the big idea stems from its
    pressing relevance in Sri Lanka. The country generates about 7,000 tons of solid waste daily, with urban areas
    projected to reach 1.0 kg per person per day by 2025. This leads to environmental degradation, such as pollution of
    rivers and beaches, and health risks from open dumping. Economic factors, including the 2022 crisis that exacerbated
    import dependencies and waste-related costs, make this area critical. For a group of mechanical and mechatronics
    engineering students, it offers direct application of skills in designing systems, automation, and sustainable
    technologies. It aligns with national policies like the National Environmental Policy and Vision 2030, which
    emphasize circular economy principles to reduce waste and promote resource efficiency. Choosing this builds career
    experience in emerging fields like cleantech and sustainable manufacturing, where demand is high from companies such
    as Polychem and international partners like UNDP.</p>
<p>Essential questions considered within this big idea include the following. These questions explore the core aspects
    of waste generation, handling, and recovery, leading to identifiable challenges.</p>
<ul>
    <li>How does rapid urbanization and population growth in Sri Lanka contribute to increasing waste volumes, and what
        systemic changes are needed to manage it sustainably?</li>
    <li>In what ways can waste segregation at the source be improved to enhance recycling rates and reduce landfill
        dependency?</li>
    <li>What role do policies and regulations play in transitioning Sri Lanka to a circular economy, and where do gaps
        exist in enforcement?</li>
    <li>How can technology integrate with traditional waste management practices to address inefficiencies in
        collection, sorting, and processing?</li>
    <li>What are the environmental and economic impacts of plastic and e-waste mismanagement, and how can extended
        producer responsibility mitigate them?</li>
    <li>How do cultural attitudes and public awareness influence waste behaviors, and what education strategies could
        shift them toward circular practices?</li>
    <li>What opportunities exist for reusing materials in industries like construction and manufacturing to close
        resource loops?</li>
</ul>
<p>Challenges in the big idea:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Absence of effective waste segregation at household and commercial levels, leading to contaminated recyclables.
    </li>
    <li>Inadequate collection mechanisms, especially in rural and peri-urban areas, resulting in illegal dumping.</li>
    <li>Insufficient recycling infrastructure, with only about 20% of waste recycled nationally.</li>
    <li>Management of e-waste, including poor policies and limited formal recycling facilities.</li>
    <li>Plastic pollution from single-use items, overwhelming marine and terrestrial ecosystems.</li>
    <li>High reliance on landfills, causing methane emissions and land scarcity issues.</li>
    <li>Lack of public awareness and education on circular economy practices.</li>
    <li>Ineffective implementation of reuse and recycling in the construction sector.</li>
    <li>Funding and technological barriers for small-scale waste-to-energy or upcycling initiatives.</li>
    <li>Coordination gaps between government, private sector, and communities in waste governance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The selected challenge is &quot;Insufficient recycling infrastructure, with only about 20% of waste recycled
    nationally.&quot; This challenge stands out because it directly ties to engineering solutions like automated
    systems, which your group can prototype. It addresses a quantifiable issue supported by data from sources like the
    Central Environmental Authority, where low recycling rates contribute to annual economic losses of millions in
    potential resource recovery. For mechanical and mechatronics students, it allows hands-on work with robotics,
    sensors, and material handling, offering practical experience for careers in automation firms. It also aligns with
    ongoing initiatives, such as the 2025 UNDP-Coca-Cola plastic waste project in Colombo, providing real-world
    validation and potential for pilot testing.</p>
<p>Guiding questions for the selected challenge:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What current technologies exist globally for automated waste sorting, and how can they be adapted to Sri
        Lanka&#39;s mixed waste streams?</li>
    <li>How do factors like humidity and waste composition in tropical climates affect recycling equipment durability?
    </li>
    <li>What sensors and algorithms are most effective for identifying recyclable materials in real-time?</li>
    <li>How can low-cost materials and local manufacturing reduce the implementation barriers for recycling systems?
    </li>
    <li>What are the energy requirements and environmental impacts of scaling up recycling infrastructure?</li>
    <li>How do stakeholder inputs from municipalities and recyclers influence system design?</li>
    <li>What metrics, such as recycling efficiency or cost savings, should evaluate the success of new infrastructure?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Activities, resources, and findings related to the guiding questions appear below. These draw from structured
    research, including field observations and data analysis, to support project development.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Activity for technology adaptation</strong>: Conduct a comparative analysis of global systems (e.g.,
            AMP Robotics in the US) versus local needs. Prototype a small-scale sorter using Arduino boards and computer
            vision software like OpenCV. Finding: Adaptations for Sri Lanka&#39;s high organic waste (60% of total)
            require moisture-resistant sensors; tests show 70-80% accuracy in sorting plastics and metals.</p>
